I am a principal research scientist at [CSIRO's Data61](https://data61.csiro.au) where I lead the Foundations and Methods team within the Machine Learning Research Group. Most of my work revolves around uncertainty quantification, probabilistic modelling and efficient probabilistic inference, usually adopting a Bayesian perspective. Interests include transfer learning, Gaussian processes and graph neural networks.  I have worked in applications such as geophysical inversions, computer vision, document analysis, spatio-temporal modelling and product recommendation.
